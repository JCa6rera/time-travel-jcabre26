# Time Travel Zine
I am learning Git and branching by creating a time-travel themed zine.

# Gitignore Explanation
Ignore .DS_Store (macOS system files) and *.log(temp log files) so our repo is clean and only contains necessary files.

#Branch Usage
- author/idea-sprint: for writing/developing zine content.
- editor/review: for reviewing/editing the author's work
